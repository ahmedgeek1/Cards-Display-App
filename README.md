# Cards-Display-App
Create a Form that has 4 PictureBox controls and 4 Buttons.  In the Student Data Files, go to ‘Images>Cards >Poker – Large’ and choose any 4 images.  Set the PictureBoxes to display the card images, then make the PictureBoxes invisible. 

Set up the Buttons so that they show the names of the cards you chose (‘7 of Diamonds’, ‘Jack’, ‘Ace of Hearts’, etc.), and when the user clicks on a Button, the appropriate PictureBox (the one that is set to that card) will become visible.  Cards should remain visible - if a user clicks three Buttons, then at that point three PictureBoxes will be visible. 

Add two more Buttons – one to ‘Reset’ all the cards (PictureBoxes) back to invisible, and one to 'Close' the application.

The layout for this application is up to you and doesn't need to be anything fancy, but it should show some sense of design consideration and usability.  The form should be neat, not cluttered, not too big, but not so small that the user must scroll to see all the controls.  PictureBoxes should show the full card image, Buttons should not have text cut off, and similar items should be aligned neatly and sized similarly (i.e. the Buttons should not be 6 different sizes and scattered willy nilly all over the form….) Also make sure that all controls have the appropriate properties set (Name, Text, etc.)!
